### Description
Full color silkscreening process. The process sucked, and I was forced to learn EasyEDA in order to generate the files that JLCPCB will accept (surprise, it's super annoying and even if you do it right, it goes wrong.)

The whole process sucked, and while I'm excited to have these badges, I am gonna make hamster handle the BS  of color silkscreening. Maybe I can have boards assembled for cheap and then just ship them over to him.
