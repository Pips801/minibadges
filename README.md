### Descrption
An obnoxiously-loud buzzer with an obnoxiously bright and large button. How tempting! Who wouldn't want to press that? Due to the length of the buzzer, the minibadge needs extra-long pin headers to connect snug with the socket.
### Assembly Instructions
First, solder all of the LEDs and resistors. if you are missing R1 (a potentiometer), the simply bridge the pad that says "NO R1" with solder. The potentiometer is meant for volume control. Next, solder the buzzer on the back of the badge, then with some good cutters, snip the leads of the speaker as flush as you can get them. After that, solder the comically large button on the front.

### Description
A compact 2x2 Minibadge display with the same clock module as the 10x10 minibadge grid. If this device works well, it can be scaled up to 10 minibadges (probaby 9, 3x3 grid) without changing out any components or altering the diagram. The USB-C port is Charge only and is configured with a 5.1k pulldown resistor to request 5V, however you are limited to approx 500mA from the DC-DC converter. 
### Assembly Instructions
Using a pre-soldered minibadge as a guide/holder, solder all pin sockets.

### Instructions
Solder the 1x10 pin header row downwards. Solder the 2x 1x8 pin sockets facing upwards. Optionally, bridge the SDA and SCL pads and use a Flipper Zero app that can read I2C communications. Do not bridge the CLK pad - it does not work correctly for badges that use CLK for alternating light patters.

### Description
This, Jen, is the Internet. 
### Assembly
First, solder the through-hole resistor on the back side of the minibadge, and then snip the legs around the front. Next, take the black box, and insert the LED into the hole in the box. Ensure that the LED is pushed down as far as it can be and is snug. Next, put the LED legs through the correct holes (long +, short -) and line up the LED and box on the board. Hot-glue/super-glue the box onto the board, and then solder the legs of the LED. Last, solder the Minibadge's pin legs. If assembled correctly, it should blink red on and off (the LED has an IC that makes it blink)

### Description
Full color silkscreening process. The process sucked, and I was forced to learn EasyEDA in order to generate the files that JLCPCB will accept (surprise, it's super annoying and even if you do it right, it goes wrong.) 
The whole process sucked, and while I'm excited to have these badges, I am gonna make hamster handle the BS  of color silkscreening. Maybe I can have boards assembled for cheap and then just ship them over to him.

### Description
A scratch and sniff minibadgebadge. Stupid idea that came about from 801 Labs. The badge has a very small scratch and sniff sticker overlayed on the front. The sticker will be one of the 5 scents I used for this project, as follows

- DNS (Wet Dirt)
- TOR (Onion)
- Zodiak's Sandals (Cheese)
- Magic Smoke (Burnt Rubber)
- Vendor Call (Manure)
  
Honestly, they all smell bad. (which was the point) I may make a second round that smells nice, that would be easier to work with.

### Description
Revamped BLANK_BADGE, this time with two different colors. I messed up my board shop settings on this one, and they helpfully made them sinly pannels. I tried to get them to do it again but they have minimum sizes and I was unable to intentionally do this again.
