### Description
Full color silkscreening process. The process sucked, and I was forced to learn EasyEDA in order to generate the files that JLCPCB will accept (surprise, it's super annoying and even if you do it right, it goes wrong.)

The whole process sucked, and while I'm excited to have these badges, I am gonna make hamster handle the BS  of color silkscreening. Maybe I can have boards assembled for cheap and then just ship them over to him.

### Description
A scratch and sniff minibadgebadge. Stupid idea that came about from 801 Labs. The badge has a very small scratch and sniff sticker overlayed on the front. The sticker will be one of the 5 scents I used for this project, as follows

- DNS (Wet Dirt)
- TOR (Onion)
- Zodiak's Sandals (Cheese)
- Magic Smoke (Burnt Rubber)
- Vendor Call (Manure)
  
Honestly, they all smell bad. (which was the point) I may make a second round that smells nice, that would be easier to work with.

### Description
Revamped BLANK_BADGE, this time with two different colors. I messed up my board shop settings on this one, and they helpfully made them sinly pannels. I tried to get them to do it again but they have minimum sizes and I was unable to intentionally do this again.
