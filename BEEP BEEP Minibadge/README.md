## Descrption
An obnoxiously-loud buzzer with an obnoxiously bright and large button. How tempting! Who wouldn't want to press that? Due to the length of the buzzer, the minibadge needs extra-long pin headers to connect snug with the socket.
## Assembly Instructions
First, solder all of the LEDs and resistors. if you are missing R1 (a potentiometer), the simply bridge the pad that says "NO R1" with solder. The potentiometer is meant for volume control. Next, solder the buzzer on the back of the badge, then with some good cutters, snip the leads of the speaker as flush as you can get them. After that, solder the comically large button on the front.
