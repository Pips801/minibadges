### Description
A scratch and sniff minibadgebadge. Stupid idea that came about from 801 Labs. The badge has a very small scratch and sniff sticker overlayed on the front. The sticker will be one of the 5 scents I used for this project, as follows

- DNS (Wet Dirt)
- TOR (Onion)
- Zodiak's Sandals (Cheese)
- Magic Smoke (Burnt Rubber)
- Vendor Call (Manure)
  
Honestly, they all smell bad. (which was the point) I may make a second round that smells nice, that would be easier to work with.
